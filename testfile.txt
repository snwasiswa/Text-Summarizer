Shooting in Seattle raises worries about safety in the protesters’ ‘autonomous zone.’

The protester-run district in Seattle known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone or the Capitol Hill Organized Protest area has been celebrated as a “no cop” zone where the community takes care of public safety. Since the city made the unusual decision last month to abandon a police station in the neighborhood, the police have largely stayed out to avoid clashing with the protesters, to the point of asking people who call for assistance, in all but the most serious situations, to meet them at the edge of the zone.

But the viability of that approach came into question after an eruption of gunfire inside the zone early Saturday, when one person died and another was critically injured.

Fire Department medics responding to the shooting stopped a block away, saying they needed to wait until the police declared the scene to be safe for them to enter. By the time the police tried to move in and do that, it appears that some 20 minutes had passed. Protesters expressed anger that the officers were there even though the first shooting victim had already been taken away by volunteer medics, who expressed frustration at the delay in getting aid.

A Seattle Police Department statement said that detectives were investigating the shooting “despite the challenges presented by the circumstances.” The police said that the suspect or suspects in the shooting had fled, and that the motive was unknown.
“Officers attempted to locate a shooting victim but were met by a violent crowd that prevented officers’ safe access to the victims,” the police statement said.

The city has been working to alter barricades surrounding in the zone to give access to emergency personnel access. But John Moore, 23, one of the volunteer medics on the scene early Saturday, said the Fire Department would not come in.
